### 6. Visualization & UI/UX Tools

- **Interactive Visualizations:**  
  • Use of **D3.js** and **Three.js** for rendering 2D/3D diagrams, geodesic paths, spacetime grids, and tensor field visualizations.  
  • Tools for exporting visual content as **PNG, SVG, or GIF**.

- **UI/UX Design:**  
  • A dark-mode-first approach with high contrast, customizable inputs, tooltips, and step-by-step guidance to enhance usability for both experts and enthusiasts.

- **Wireframing & Prototyping:**  
  • Initial wireframes and visual designs serve as a blueprint for the application’s look and feel.
