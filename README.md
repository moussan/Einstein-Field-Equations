# Einstein Field Equations
 Einstein Field Equations Computational Platform



## Project Structure
### Explanation
docs/: Contains all project documentation—from the BRD (which outlines the feature set and technical requirements) to architecture diagrams, design guidelines, and user manuals.
frontend/: Houses the client-side code. Organized into public assets, source components (with separate folders for authentication, dashboard, calculation views, etc.), style files, and utility scripts.
backend/: Contains the server-side code (whether using Python’s FastAPI or Node.js). This area includes API routes (for authentication, calculation requests, visualization data, etc.), models, controllers, and service layers. Also includes configuration and tests.
computation/: Holds all numerical and symbolic computation modules. This includes solvers for various Einstein Field Equation scenarios, numerical methods, and simulation modules.
visualizations/: Provides components and utilities for rendering interactive diagrams, plots, and exporting visualizations in different formats.
auth/: Dedicated to authentication logic, including OAuth integrations and JWT management.
config/: Environment-specific configuration files for development, staging, and production.
deployment/: Contains Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, and other deployment scripts to support continuous delivery and scalable deployment.
tests/: Organizes unit, integration, and performance tests across the system.
scripts/: Contains miscellaneous scripts for project setup, database migrations, and backups.
logs/: A directory for log files (typically excluded from version control).
README.md: Provides an overview, setup instructions, and other essential information.
